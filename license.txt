Form Validation plugin
The form validation plugin has an overloaded first parameter and takes and object or an array of objects and has a second option parameter that takes a function as a callback. If you pass the plugin a single object it will push it into an array for you.
$().jcg().validateFields([object or array],[optional callback]);
Examples of using:
//single object
$().jcg().validateFields(zipcitystate);
//single object with callback
$().jcg().validateFields(zipcitystate,myFunc);
//array of objects
$().jcg().validateFields(myArray);
//array of objects with callback
$().jcg().validateFields(myArray,myFunc);
 
An example object:

var  zipcitystate = {
     inputName: "#zipCityState",  // the name of the input we are defining rules for
     checkAgainst: {              //add any value you want to check for here
         empty: true,             //true to check if field is empty, otherwise add false
         zip: false,             // currently true would check for a full five digits
         stringVal: "Please enter a city, state or zip", //added but not used, just in case as an example
         placeholder: false,       //empty placeholder value before submit if true
         keyStrokes: true,        //if true do not allow certain chars                 
     },   
      errorMessages: {
         empty: "Please enter a city, state or zip"   //this is the message that will be displayed if the field is empty
      },
      regex: {
          regexZip: /^[0-9]{5}$/,     //regex match for zip code 
          regexKeyup: /^[0-9A-Za-z ,!\.']*$/ //these are the keystrokes that are allowed
      },
   error: error    //pass error messaging to plugin â€“ could be any error messaging but would need refinement if so
 }

You can currently do the following things:

Check all keystrokes and disallow certain characters.
Check for a 5 digit zip code
Check for an empty value
Make sure placeholder values are cleared before submission (Stops incorrect data forming part of URL

The plugin has been written to easilt allow additional checks to be added. To add a new check:

1)	Add a new property to the localGlobal object
2)	Add this property to the object you pass to the plugin
3)	(optional) Add a error message to the object
4)	Check for that condition in the loop inside _localGlobal.checkValues()

The plugin had been added to the jquery namespace, but could be removed and used as a standalone plugin with jquery dependencies.
